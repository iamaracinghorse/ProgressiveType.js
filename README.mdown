# ProgressiveType.js

This is an experimental plugin that animates typing unto the screen, like some invisible being is inside your machine, creating content while you watch. It's kinda like what the monitors in the background of sci-fi movies always look like. Or at least that's the intent. It is very much a work-in-progess.
